      'Hi {name}! Here is your summary for June 2026: you received 2 credits ' +
      'totalling NPR {credits} (salary and a remittance) and made {debitCount} ' +
      'payments totalling NPR {debits}. Your biggest expense category was ' +
      'groceries, followed by utilities. Overall you saved about NPR {net} ' +
      'this month — nice work! 🎉',

  {
    id: 'current-balance',
    question: 'What is my current account balance?',

      'Your savings account (…{last4}) currently holds NPR {balance}. ' +
      'That is your available balance — there are no pending holds on the account.',

  {
    id: 'grocery-spend',
    question: 'How much did I spend on groceries this month?',
    reply:
      'Looking at June 2026, I found your grocery purchases at Bhatbhateni and ' +
      'Salesberry — they add up to NPR {grocery}. That is roughly {groceryPct}% ' +
      'of your total spending this month.',
  },
  {
    id: 'savings-tips',
    question: 'Give me savings tips based on my spending',
    reply:
      'Based on your recent activity, {name}, here are three ideas: ' +
      '1) Your utility bills are steady — setting up auto-pay avoids late fees. ' +
      '2) Grocery spending peaks at month start; a weekly budget of NPR 5,000 ' +
      'would leave more in savings. 3) Moving NPR 10,000 monthly into a fixed ' +
      'deposit at 7.1% would earn you about NPR 4,600 extra in a year.',
